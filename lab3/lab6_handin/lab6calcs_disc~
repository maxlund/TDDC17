a) 
no observations, P(meltdown) = 0.02578
P(meltdown|icyweather) = 0.03472

b) 
The risk of a meltdown if there is an actual water leak is greater since
the probability of a meltdown is conditioned by the variable 'water leak'.
Note that the observation of the water leak does not influence the result significantly, compared with the actual water leak  

P(meltdown|-pumpfailure,-icyweather,waterleakwarning) = 0.068
P(meltdown|-pumpfailure,-icyweather,waterleakwarning,waterleak) = 0.1

P(L) = 0.105
P(-L) = 0.895
P(W|L) = 0.9
P(W|-L) = 0.05
P(W) = P(W|L) * P(L) + P(W|-L) * P(-L) = 0.9 * 0.105 + 0.05 * 0.895 = 0.13925

P(L|W) = P(W|L) / P(W) * P(L) = 0.9 / 0.13925 * 0.105 = 0.67864

P(-L|W) = P(W|-L) / P(W) * P(-L) = 0.05 / 0.13925 * 0.895 = 0.32136

P(M|W) = P(M|L) * P(L|W) + P(M|-L) * P(-L|W) = 0.1 * 0.67864 + 0.001 * 0.32136 = 0.068

c)
Both  because some of the probabilities are in practice impossible to estimate by observing live situations - they can only be estimated by doing artificial reconstructions of real life scenarios through experiments. How well these experiments mirror the real world scenarios might be hard to know for certain, such as those for Meltdown, PumpFailure or WaterLeak. Also, the variable IcyWeather might be hard to correctly estimate, since detailed conditions of weather is a notoriously difficult thing to predict. A third component is the cost of conducting the experiments, some might be very expensive.

d)
Changing the IcyWeather variable to Temperature would mean we don't have a binary set of values for the variable, but rather an interval of values for different temperatures. This would mean we need more observations in for the network to establish probabilities that are conditioned by the Temperature variable. One would need to discrete the temperature signal into a number of steps that are relevant for the purpose, e.g. in 50 C steps, or steam, liquid, frozen.

5.
a)
The probability of all the possible outcomes.

b)
The probabilities of all combinations of values for the variables in the distribution. 

P(-Icy)=0.95
P(-PF)=0.9
P(-WL)=0.9
P(-PFW)=0.87
P(-WLW)=0.86
P(-M)=0.97

P(Meltdown=F, PumpFailureWarning=F, PumpFailure=F, WaterLeakWaring=F, WaterLeak=F, IcyWeather=F) = 
P(M=F|PF=F ^ WL=F)* P(-PF) * P(-PFW|-PF) * P(WLW=F|WL=F) * P(-WL|-Icy) * P(-Icy) = 
0.999 * 0.9 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.9 * 0.95 = 0.694

c) The probability of a meltdown when observing both a water leak and a pump failure is 20%. Meltdown is conditioned on water leak and a pump failure and it does not matter if water leak warning and a pump failure warning are changed.

Part III

a) The probability of surviving decreases since the probability of the variable battery is conditioned by the variable radio - observing the value of radio as false raises the probability of not having battery, which in turn effects subsequent variables conditioned by the variable battery, making the probability of the variable 'survives' decrease.

b) Meltdown and pump failure warning are conditioned on Pump failure and independent of each other:
P(MeltDown, PumpFailureWarning|PumpFailure) = P(MeltDown|PumpFailure) * P(PumpFailureWarning|PumpFailure)
Ignition and Radio are conditioned on Battery but independent from each other:
P(Ignition, Radio|Battery) = P(Ignition|Battery) * P(Radio|Battery)  

Part IV

2.
a) Depending on the probabilities set for Mr.HS failing to react properly to the warnings, and depending on the new, lower probability for a pump failure with a new pump, a new and better pump could potentially compensate for Mr HS's lack of competence and reaction. However, when tuning the parameters in our model we found that a minor change of the experts reactivity and competence will reduce the probability more significantly than what a new pump can do.
